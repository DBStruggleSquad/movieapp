# Sprint 0

#####What worked well? #####
For our initial phase in the development of our we we're able to "jell" together with out any problems.
We divided up the work and did it efficiently with each team member pulling their weight throughout the
sprint.

#####What didn't work well? #####
 Nothing particular to report on this section for this sprint(0).
 
#####What we learned? #####
We were able to learn about the different technologies available to us in these types of projects as well
as decided which wanted we wanted to use based and our needs and the benefits of each teachnologies. We 
planed out the differents aspects of our web app through the development of our functional requierements
and set out to plan our different sprints based on these requierements.

#####Planned work for Sprint 1.#####
* ER Mapping and working DBMS instance hosted somewhere on the Cloud
* App (client side) mock screenshots and/or wire frames with matching
requirements and task descriptions
* Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task
* Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint II
Updated Master Project Development Plan

# Sprint 1

#####What worked well? #####
The team development of how the app was supposed to look went great as well as our division of work.

#####What didn't work well? #####
 Instalation of some software needed as well as their dependencies on ubuntu was somewhat of a pain.
 
#####What we learned? #####
The software needed to succesfully host the DBMS as well as the necessary set up to access it.

#####Planned work for Sprint 2.#####
* Finish the whole front end.
* Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task
* Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint II
Updated Master Project Development Plan

# Sprint 2

#####What worked well? #####
Katyas help and experience helped us greatly as we implemented from scratch the wireframes on which our GUI. 
Once we had a solid grasp on the techonologies we we're using and what we had to do, everything progressed a lot smoother.

#####What didn't work well? #####
 The mixing and importing of some modules from differente frameworks didn't act as we wanted them too so we had to play with different modules and directives that did the same thign to get the look we wanted.
 
#####What we learned? #####
Mixing various technologies to get the exact look we wated as well development from html, css and the diffrente flavors of JS.

#####Planned work for Sprint 3.#####
* Build REST API.
* Refine UI.
* Build Search.
* Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task
* Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint II
Updated Master Project Development Plan


# Sprint 3

#####What worked well? #####
Rest API design flowed well. UI was refined some more.

#####What didn't work well? #####
 Populating the DB is taking longer than expected due to the number of tables.
 
#####What we learned? #####
Gotta optimize our time more.

#####Planned work for Sprint 4.#####
* Finish testing REST API.
* Check that everything that is built in the UI is fully functional.
* Refine UI.
* Updated Gantt chart with percent completion for each task
* Detailed Project Development Plan for Sprint 5
Updated Master Project Development Plan

# Sprint 4

#####What worked well? #####
Back end work was improved as well as some more UI optimization.

#####What didn't work well? #####
 Due to issues outside our control we we'rent able to finish as much as we wanted.
 
#####What we learned? #####
Gotta optimize our time more.

#####Planned work for Sprint 5#####
* Finish the project.

# Sprint 5

#####What worked well? #####
Adding the email notifications was relatively straightforward and did not take as much time as we had anticipated. Setting up the RESTful services and user authentification also went well thanks to some of the libraries available to Flask.

#####What didn't work well? #####
We found some minor issues in our queries, where the data obtained was not the data expected. However, we spotted them on time and were able to fix the issues. Implementing the user and movie search took us more time than expected because we were having issues transferring data from one controller to another. Ultimately, we decided to take advantage of HTML5's local storage to perform this transfer. We also had some issues setting up some of the front-end features (they were not behaving the way we wanted them to) such as modals and positioning divs.
 
#####What we learned? #####
We gained a lot of experience working with tools that were new to us and got a feel about what it is like to bring to life a heavy project/application. Due to unexpected events, we were not able to follow our work plan as expected. Additionally, some features took us more (or less) time than the duration we had established. This gave us an idea of how we should arrange future work plans to better adjust to unexpected events. Overall, we are satisfied with our achievements regardless of the circumstances and we gained a lot of technical experience (the team had little or no experience working with the technologies that were selected).
