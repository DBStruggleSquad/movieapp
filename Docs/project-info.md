# FilmShack

FilmShack is a web application that provides movie enthusiasts with a place where they can connect with each other. Its aim is to have users review movies and share their favorite movies with others.

## Technologies & Frameworks

### Client-side Framework
**AngularJS** is an open-source web application framework that simplifies the development and testing of single-page applications. This means that all of the code needed to fully experience the application is loaded upon visiting the page, and resources are added dynamically as needed. We chose AngularJS because it is supported by Google and a large community of developers. This makes it easier to obtain useful resources such as online tutorials and support. AngularJS follows an MVC architecture, which eases the development process and allows better organization. It also allows for responsive web applications, which will allow *FilmShack* to be accessible from both a desktop and a mobile device, while keeping an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

###Application Server Framework
**Flask** is a micro web application framework. We chose to use Flask for its simplicity; it's a small framework, which greatly reduces its learning curve. Additionally, it allows the user to choose which extensions to use to add compatibility with AngularJS and MySQL. It is also popular amongst the Heroku Cloud community, which is another technology that we will be using.

### DBMS Technology
**MySQL** is an open-source relational database managemente system (RDBMS). Similarly to AngularJS, we chose MySQL because of its popularity in web applications, which makes it more accessible for tutorials and other useful online resources. It is also considered to be fast, easy to use (with basic knowledge of SQL) and runs on many operating systems.

### Cloud Application Platform
**Heroku** is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that allows users to develop, run and manage web applications without having to deal with the infrastructure.
